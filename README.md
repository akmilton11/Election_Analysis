## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used when proper clean data is provided. If clean data is not provided, the user(s) would have to first take the necessary steps to touch it up. There are a few things that may need to be modified for future elections. The summary page we provided does the job, but what if someone wants an even more detailed look? We've all seen the election maps in November, how about the use of historical election data? How about if more candidates choose to run? We can add more candidates to the list easy, as well as more counties if we are looking at different locations.
